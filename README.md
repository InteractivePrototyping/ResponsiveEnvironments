# ResponsiveEnvironments
Product Design Arduino project

During this project we will be looking at different inputs and outputs. Within this repository you can find example code to help get you started with different elements of physical computing. 

## Inputs

- Switch/Button
- IR sensor as a switch (digitalRead)
- IR sensor measuring distance (analogRead)

## Outputs

- Blinking light (digitalWrite)
- Fading light or motor (analogWrite)
- Servo motors
